# Application server

> The distinction between an application server and a web server is crucial in understanding how to deploy web applications effectively. 

An application server is responsible for executing the business logic and handling application-specific operations. It provides an environment for running server-side code, such as application frameworks, middleware, and database connectors. It supports the execution of dynamic, interactive, and data-driven web applications.

On the other hand, a web server's primary function is to handle HTTP requests and deliver static files to clients. It focuses on efficiently serving web content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files, to users' browsers. Web servers are optimized for handling high-volume traffic and efficiently processing static content.

## To serve a Flask application with Gunicorn and Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment and install Flask and Gunicorn to manage your Python dependencies.

2. Write your Flask application code, including routes, views, and business logic.

3. Configure Gunicorn as the application server to handle requests and manage the Flask application. Gunicorn acts as a middle layer between the web server and the application, handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

4. Install and configure Nginx as the web server to handle incoming HTTP requests and act as a reverse proxy. Nginx can efficiently handle static file serving and manage SSL termination, load balancing, and caching.

5. Configure Nginx to pass requests to Gunicorn for processing and receive responses back.

6. Secure your application by enabling HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates and configuring Nginx to handle secure connections.

7. Test the setup by accessing your Flask application through the Nginx server. Ensure that all functionality, routes, and views work as expected.

> By combining the strengths of Gunicorn as the application server and Nginx as the web server, you can achieve a scalable, secure, and high-performance deployment for your Flask application.

> Remember to follow best practices for server configuration, security, and performance optimization to ensure the smooth operation of your web application.
